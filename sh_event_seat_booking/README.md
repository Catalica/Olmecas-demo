About
============
Online event ticket helps to execute the events properly and efficiently. Online ticket booking reduces double bookings & mismanagement. This module helps you to book events such as seminars, conferences, formal parties, concerts, appointments & conventions. The event manager can add different types of tickets/screens in the backend for any event. The event manager can arrange the seat as per need and they can know the name of every participant with full details. An event manager can switch seats before registration confirmation. The attendances have to select just seats with the total price. After that, registration and last is payment. Hurray!
